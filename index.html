    <h2>REVAMP</h2>

    <p>This box was here - and filled with an alternate lorem ipsum text, for me to test out boxes, padding, etc. Right now, what I'm working on is consolidating everything to my domain via the SiteGround hosting service I'm using. The WordPress blog can
      be found on winterhillwebdev.com/wordpress, as I'm still planning on spending time to learn how to customize their themes.
    </p>

    <p>My first thought was to get good at Wordpress so I could hopefully snag some part-time work on Upwork.com, but that's gone by the wayside for the time being. I'm 75% of the way through the "Web Dev Bootcamp" course I'm taking on Udemy, and hate having
      my time taken away by other things. The blessing and the curse of trying to learn web dev online is that there are a million resources. It's great because there are answers to pretty much everything I want to do, but a curse in that there are a
      billion shiny objects to distract me.</p>
